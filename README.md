These projects are developed for a course that focuses on artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques for computer games. I have learned both
basic and advanced AI techniques that are used in a variety of game
genres including first-person shooters, driving games, strategy games,
platformers, etc. The course has emphasized the difference between
traditional AI and game AI, the latter having a strong design component,
focusing on creating games that are "fun to play". Specifically, the
topics we will cover in class are basic AI techniques, algorithms, and
data structures used for character movement, pathfinding,
decision-making, strategy, content generation, and machine learning in
games. Refer to individual projectsâ€™ README for more info.
